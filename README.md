# SwierVision
SwierVision is a Fork of KlipperScreen, a Front-End for Klipper.
SwierVision was designed and optimized for Syncraft printers using IDEX, and works correctly using a specific set of files, settings, and other installed software.
Trying to use SwierVision on a generic printer will cause the software to malfunction.

SwierVision would not be possible without the KlipperScreen development team, the Syncraft development team is very grateful for their contributions to the Klipper community.
